# SYSC3303Project - Elevator Control System

## Description
Iteration_2 of SYSC3303 for Group 8.  
Building off of Iteration I, Scheduler and Elevator Subsystems now have state machines. Project was heavily refactored in this Iteration.

## Installation
To import the project into IntelliJ IDEA from VCS:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select **"Get from Version Control"** on the welcome screen.
2. In the URL field, enter `https://github.com/Zhangjason308/SYSC3303Project.git`.
3. Choose the directory where you want to clone the project and click **"Clone"**.
4. Once cloned, IntelliJ IDEA may NOT automatically set up everything needed to run the project.
   To run the unit tests for the `U_Test` class:
   Add 'JUnit5.8.1' to class path via ðŸ’¡ContextActions
5. Ensure Java SDK 21.0.1 is set up in the project structure. This project is developed with Java 21 but should be compatible with most Java versions.

# Project Structure

## Documentation
- **Iteration_1**: Contains documentation and resources for iteration 1.
- **Iteration_2**: Contains documentation and resources for iteration 2.

## Elevator
- **StateMachine**: Contains the elevator state machine related classes.
  - **States**
    - `DoorsClosedState.java`: Handles the state of the elevator when the doors are closed.
    - `DoorsOpenState.java`: Manages the state of the elevator when the doors are open.
    - `ElevatorState.java`: Interface for the different states of the elevator.
    - `IdleState.java`: Represents the elevator's idle state.
    - `MovingDownState.java`: Manages the elevator moving downwards.
    - `MovingUpState.java`: Manages the elevator moving upwards.
    - `StoppedState.java`: Represents the elevator when it is stopped.
  - `ElevatorStateMachine.java`: Manages state transitions of the elevator.
- `ElevatorSubsystem.java`: Simulates the overall operation of the elevator.

##Floor
  - `FloorData.java`: Data model representing the floor requests.
  - `FloorSubsystem.java`: Handles floor request inputs and processing.

## Scheduler
- **StateMachine**: Contains the scheduler state machine related classes.
  - **States**: Defines the possible states of the scheduler and their behavior.
    - `CommandCompleteState.java`: State after a command has been executed.
    - `CommandSelectedState.java`: State when a command is selected.
    - `IdleState.java`: The idle state of the scheduler.
    - `SchedulerState.java`: Interface for the states of the scheduler.
    - `WaitingForArrivalSensorState.java`: State during waiting for arrival sensor signal.
    - `WaitingForDestinationSensorState.java`: State during waiting for destination arrival sensor signal.
  - `SchedulerStateMachine.java`: Manages the transitions between scheduler states.
  - `SchedulerSubsystem.java`: Coordinates the scheduling of elevator movements.

## Test
- `Test_1.csv`: Test data set for the first test scenario.
- `Test_2.csv`: Test data set for the second test scenario.
- `U_Test.java`: Unit test suite for the system.

## Core
- `DirectionEnum.java`: Enumeration that defines the elevator's possible directions.
- `ElevatorEvents.csv`: CSV file containing a list of elevator events for simulation.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file providing an overview of the project.
- `Synchronizer.java`: Synchronizes communication between various subsystems.
- `ThreadMain.java`: The main class that launches the system and initializes all subsystems.

## Unit Testing Instructions
To run the unit tests for the `U_Test` class:
Add 'JUnit5.8.1' to class path via ðŸ’¡ContextActions

### Using IntelliJ IDEA
1. Navigate to the `src/test/java/SYSC3303Project/Test` directory in the Project view.
2. Right-click on the `U_Test` class and select **Run 'U_Test'**.
3. IntelliJ IDEA will execute all the unit tests in the `U_Test` class, and you can view the results in the Run window.
